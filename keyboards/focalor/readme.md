The design of the keyboard has a 5x3 split keyboard layout with 3 thumb keys.
The design was inspired by Corne and Kyria but it was slighty adapted for my hands using [ergopad](https://pashutk.ru/ergopad/)
The design was also made so it has the exact number of keys needed for the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout.

Design Steps:
* The PCB was designed using yaml configuration for [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen/)
* The routing was done afterwards using [kikad](https://www.kicad.org/)
